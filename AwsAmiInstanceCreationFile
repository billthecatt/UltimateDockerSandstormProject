Here is the script that we're working on so far:

#!/bin/bash

#get the system installed and install some of the basics we'll need for this all to work..
yum update -y
yum install htop -y
yum install wget -y
yum install nano -y
ln /bin/nano /bin/pico -s
yum install unzip -y

#yum install -y httpd
#systemctl start httpd
#systemctl enable httpd
#echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

#If you use an ECS AMI the below commands aren't needed because the ECS instance has docker preloaded and ready to go!
amazon-linux-extras install docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

#on login run the following to test that docker has been fully installed : docker info
